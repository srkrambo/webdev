<h2>Week 1: Links & Attributes</h2>
<p>Links, or hyperlinks, are what make the web a "web." They connect pages and resources, allowing users to navigate between them. HTML tags can also have attributes, which provide extra information about an element.</p>

<h3>Core Concepts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>The Anchor Tag:</strong> The <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag (for "anchor") creates a hyperlink. The text between the opening and closing tags becomes the clickable link.</li>
    <li><strong>The <code>href</code> Attribute:</strong> This is the most important attribute. It specifies the destination URL (e.g., <code>href="https://www.google.com"</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>The <code>target</code> Attribute:</strong> Controls where the link opens. Use <code>target="_blank"</code> to open the link in a new tab, which is common for external sites.</li>
    <li><strong>The <code>title</code> Attribute:</strong> Provides extra information about the link, which often appears as a tooltip when you hover over it.</li>
    <li><strong>Link Types:</strong> You can link to external websites, other pages on your own site (e.g., <code>href="/about.html"</code>), sections on the same page (<code>href="#contact"</code>), or even trigger an email client (<code>href="mailto:test@example.com"</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interactive Example</h3>
<p>Let's create an "About Me" page. It will have a link to an external site that opens in a new tab, and a link that jumps down to a "Contact" section on the same page.</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Create an image that acts as a link. To do this, you'll need to place an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag inside an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<div class="lesson-nav">
    <button id="prev-lesson-button">&laquo; Previous</button>
    <button id="next-lesson-button">Next &raquo;</button>
</div>
