<h2>Week 1: Document Structure</h2>
<p>Every HTML page is built on a foundation of essential tags. These tags don't display content directly, but they tell the browser what kind of document it is and how to start rendering it.</p>

<h3>Core Concepts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>: This is the very first thing in your document. It tells the browser that the page is written in modern HTML (HTML5).</li>
    <li><code>&lt;html&gt;</code>: This is the root element that wraps all the content on the entire page.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;head&gt;</code>: This section contains meta-information about the page that isn't displayed directly. This includes the page title, character set, and links to stylesheets.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;body&gt;</code>: This section contains all the visible content of the web page, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;title&gt;</code>: Sets the title of the page, which appears in the browser tab.</li>
    <li><code>&lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;</code>: Ensures the browser interprets characters correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Interactive Example</h3>
<p>Here is the essential boilerplate for any HTML page. Use this as a starting point for all your projects. Try running it to see what happens (hint: not much will appear in the preview, but you've created a valid, empty webpage!).</p>

<h3>Exercise</h3>
<p><strong>Task:</strong> Create a new HTML page using this boilerplate and give it a unique title that appears in the browser tab.</p>

<div class="lesson-nav">
    <button id="prev-lesson-button">&laquo; Previous</button>
    <button id="next-lesson-button">Next &raquo;</button>
</div>
