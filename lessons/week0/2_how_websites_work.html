<h2>Week 0: How Websites Work</h2>
<p>Ever wondered what happens when you type a website address and hit Enter? Let's break it down.</p>

<h3>Core Concepts</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Client:</strong> This is your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox). It *requests* information.</li>
    <li><strong>Server:</strong> This is a powerful computer somewhere else in the world that stores the website's files. It *serves* information.</li>
    <li>When you go to a website, your browser (the client) sends a request over the internet to the website's server. The server finds the right files (HTML, CSS, JS) and sends them back to your browser. Your browser then reads those files to display the page.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Three Pillars of the Web</h3>
<p>Think of it like building a house:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HTML:</strong> The Nouns (the structure, the "bones").</li>
    <li><strong>CSS:</strong> The Adjectives (the styling, the "decoration").</li>
    <li><strong>JavaScript (JS):</strong> The Verbs (the interactivity, the "electricity").</li>
</ul>
