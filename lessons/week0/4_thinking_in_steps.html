<h2>Week 0: Thinking in Steps</h2>
<p>Programming isn't just about writing code; it's about solving problems. The key is to think in small, logical steps.</p>

<h3>What is an Algorithm?</h3>
<p>An algorithm is just a fancy word for a step-by-step plan. You use them every day, like following a recipe. A computer needs these steps to be broken down into tiny, exact instructions.</p>

<h3>Planning an "About Me" Page</h3>
<p>Imagine you want to create a simple "About Me" page. You could plan it like this:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Add a main heading with my name.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add a paragraph with a short bio.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add a picture of myself.</li>
</ol>
<p>By turning a big idea into a small list of steps, the problem becomes much easier to solve.</p>
