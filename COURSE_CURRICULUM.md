The PHP script will then `echo` back the data it received. | - **Challenge:** Create a simple calculator where two numbers are sent from a form to a PHP script that calculates and displays the sum. |
| **3. Working with Files** | - Simulating a database using a JSON file.<br>- Reading from a file in PHP: `file_get_contents`.<br>- Writing to a file in PHP: `file_put_contents`.<br>- Working with JSON data: `json_encode`, `json_decode`. | - Create a `GET` endpoint (`/api/users.php`) that reads an array of users from a `users.json` file and prints it. | - **Task:** Test the new API endpoint by visiting the URL in your browser. |
| **4. Building a Basic API** | - Creating a simple router to handle different request types (e.g., `if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST')`).<br>- Implementing a `POST` endpoint that receives new user data, adds it to the JSON file, and saves it. | - Create a `POST` endpoint for your users API. Use a tool like Postman or `fetch` in the browser console to send a POST request and add a new user. | - **Challenge:** Add logic to your API to handle deleting a user based on an ID sent in the request. |

### ‚≠ê Week 15: Connecting Frontend to a Real Backend

**Objective:** Complete the full-stack loop by replacing the `localStorage` logic in the Admin Panel with `fetch` calls to the new PHP backend.

| Phase | Description | Key Skills |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **1. Reading Data** | - In the Admin Panel JavaScript, remove the `localStorage.getItem` logic.<br>- Replace it with a `fetch` call to your `GET` `/api/users.php` endpoint.<br>- Populate the initial state with the data from the server. | `fetch`, Promises, `async/await`, `useEffect`-like logic on page load |
| **2. Creating Data** | - Modify the "Create New" form submission logic.<br>- Instead of pushing to a local array and saving to `localStorage`, send a `POST` request with the new data to your PHP API using `fetch`. | `fetch` with `method: 'POST'`, setting `headers` and `body` |
| **3. Updating Data** | - Implement the "Update" functionality.<br>- This will require a new API endpoint in PHP that can identify a user by ID and update their data.<br>- The frontend will send a `POST` or `PUT` request with the updated data. | `fetch` with `method: 'POST'`, API routing |
| **4. Deleting Data** | - Implement the "Delete" functionality.<br>- Create a "delete" API endpoint in PHP that removes a user based on an ID.<br>- The frontend will send a `POST` or `DELETE` request to this endpoint. | `fetch` with `method: 'POST'`, handling request parameters |

### ‚≠ê Week 16: Final Capstone Project ‚Äì Build Your Own Website

**Objective:** Synthesize all skills learned across the entire 15-week curriculum to design, build, and deploy a complete, interactive, full-stack-simulated website from scratch. The project is chosen by the learner to maximize engagement.

| Phase | Description | Key Skills |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **1. Ideation & Design** | - Brainstorm project ideas (e.g., portfolio, recipe book, simple game, product landing page).<br>- Plan the features and draw a simple wireframe of the UI. | Project planning, UI/UX thinking |
| **2. Scaffolding & UI** | - Set up the project files and structure.<br>- Build the complete HTML and CSS for the user interface.<br>- Ensure the design is responsive. | HTML, CSS, Responsive Design, Flexbox/Grid |
| **3. Core Logic & Interactivity** | - Implement the main functionality using JavaScript.<br>- Manipulate the DOM, handle user events, and manage application state. | JavaScript, DOM Manipulation, Events, Functions, State Management |
| **4. Data Persistence** | - Integrate `localStorage` to save and retrieve data, so the user's work persists across sessions. | `localStorage`, JSON, CRUD operations |
| **5. Final Polish & Export** | - Add finishing touches, test for bugs, and ensure a good user experience.<br>- Export the final project files as a complete, standalone website. | Debugging, Testing, Code Quality |
